                <h2>Who is Luke</h2>
                <p>
                    Luke is our almost-two-year-old son. He is full of energy, has strong preferences, and is learning new things about the world every day. He sings "happy birthday" to everyone and and random objects every day. He is really into birds and can identify a surprising amount of species. He has a second and third stomach reserved for fruit and would down 10 pouches in a row if we let him. He loves to make people laugh and is overall a wonderful little guy.

                <h2>Who is this site for?</h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly for us, but we figured we might as well share with others some of the random ways that we've adjusted travel planning in case others might benefit! We admire those who don't really adjust at all and we totally get those who decide travel is too overwhelming with kids - we're somewhere in between there and it changes all the time.

                <h2>More about us</h2>
                <p>
                    We're almost 2 years in and still feeling very new to all of this. Neither of us traveled much as kids, but after college we began to travel together internationally. We had a goal to go to a new country every year and were pretty successful! Prior to Luke, we were very last minute travel planners, usually not booking things until a couple weeks before and making plans the days leading up. A lot of our travel revolves around food. We want to expose Luke to the many ways that people live and the beautiful food and cultures around the country and world!
